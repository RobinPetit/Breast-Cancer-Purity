The purity of a tumor is the proportion of cancerous cells that is present in the tumor. It is pathologists' responsibility to determine this purity
by analysing histopathological slides of the tumor and counting all the different types of cells. Yet, a pathologist is unable to analyse the whole
tumor which would take an enormous amount of time. Therefore, depending on the objective of the slide analysis, several computer-aided methods have
been developed to either segment the slides~\citep{sirinukunwattana2016locality,xing2016robust,komura2017machine}, or analyse the tumor genetically
to find the somatic DNA alterations~\citep{carter2012absolute} or even use whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing~\citep{oesper2014quantifying}.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)~\citep{weinstein2013cancer} has become an important database for cancer-related data. 250 samples have been taken from there in order to
analyze tumorous purity (both ABSOLUTE~\citep{carter2012absolute} and IHC) through mutations in genes (see Table~\ref{tab:genes}), NMF of mRNA-seq
and GSE~\citep{subramanian2005gene}.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Comparison between IHC and ABSOLUTE purities}
When comparing IHC purity versus ABSOLUTE purity, we observed that these measures only slightly correlate: Spearman's $r_S = 0.355$ and Pearson's $r_P = 0.36$.
Yet, they do correlate significantly with $p < 10^{-8}$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\hspace{-.6cm}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,trim={0 2cm 0 2cm},clip]{figs/abs_vs_ihc.eps}
\caption{\textbf{(Up)} Couples (IHC, ABSOLUTE) purities. The dot-dashed line is the theoretical $\text{IHC} = \text{ABSOLUTE}$ curve. It is known that pathologists
are biased on their work~\citep{fandel2008we}, in this case, IHC purities seem to overestimate the purity of tumors.
\textbf{(Down)} Frequency of difference between IHC purity and ABSOLUTE purity.\label{fig:abs vs ihc}}
\end{figure}

More specifically, IHC measures tend to be greater than ABSOLUTE evaluations (Figure~\ref{fig:abs vs ihc}) with a mean of $\text{IHC} - \text{ABSOLUTE}$ of $0.202$
and a standard deviation of $0.175$. This indicates that either pathologists overestimate homogeneity in tumors or ABSOLUTE underestimates it. It must be kept in
mind that ABSOLUTE has been known to underestimate purity in certain cases~\citep{oesper2014quantifying}. Still, ABSOLUTE estimations are known to be highly
accurate~\citep{carter2012absolute}.

\subsection{Influence of mutations on ABSOLUTE purity}
The distribution of the number of mutations of each gene from Table~\ref{tab:genes} is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:mutations distribution}. We can observe that for each
gene, more than $50\%$ of samples are not mutated, and that CDH1, GATA3, MAP3K1 are highly non-mutated (more than $80\%$ of samples).

Though, when summing the mutations of every gene, the mode becomes 1 mutation with only around $25\%$ of samples having no mutations at all, therefore around $75\%$
of samples have at least one of these five genes which is mutated.

\end{figure*}

Moreover, the only pairs of genes showing significant correlation ($p < 0.05$) in the number of mutations are (CDH1, GATA3), (CDH1, TP53), (MAP3K1, TP53)
and (PIK3CA, TP53). All the other pairs cannot be considered correlated (see Table~\ref{tab:correlations nb mutations}). Also, these correlations are negative and light
($-0.21 \leq r \leq -0.127$) meaning that a bigger number of mutations in TP53 is correlated with a lower number of mutations of CDH1, MAP3K1 and PIK3CA, and a
bigger number of mutations of GATA3 is correlated with a lower number of mutations of CDH1.

When aggregating all the mutations together, the correlation coefficient of these four gene pairs stays roughly constant except for (PIK3CA, TP53) for which the
correlation increased from $-0.127$ to $-0.161$. Also a new pair of genes has become significantly correlated: (CDH1, PIK3CA); and except that one pair,
no pair has changed significance threshold. We also noticed that this last pair has positive correlation.

\end{figure}

No dependence between the number of mutations of any gene and the ABSOLUTE purity (nor from the sum of all mutations and the ABSOLUTE purity) was detectable
(Figure~\ref{fig:nb mutations vs abs}): these quantities are independent to one another. Even when aggregating all the mutations such that each gene is either
mutated or non-mutated, no dependence is noticeable (Figure~\ref{fig:nb mutations vs abs binarized}).

The same result stands for the independence of the mutations (or number of mutations) and the IHC purity (see Figures~\ref{fig:nb mutations vs ihc}
and~\ref{fig:nb mutations vs ihc binarized}).

\subsection{Clustering}

Out of the 7 clusters provided by TCGA, clusters 6 and 7 are significantly smaller than the other ones (Figures~\ref{fig:all clusters size}~and~\ref{fig:silhouettes}),
and we observed that the distribution of the samples into the clusters is highly unequal (Figure~\ref{fig:all clusters size}). Also, we noticed that beside not being
equal in size in the original data, the clusters do not contain the same proportion of the studied samples: the kept proportion in the restrained clusters is not
constant.

When looking at a cluster that would be linked to higher purity than the others, only clusters 1 and 4 showed significance (with respectively $p = 1.45 \times 10^{-7}$
and $p = 5.33 \times 10^{-4}$), and when looking at clusters that would be linked to higher purity than the whole set of samples, the same two were found
(with respectively $p = 2.55 \times 10^{-5}$ and $p = 4.72 \times 10^{-3}$).

Significance of difference between the mean ABSOLUTE purity between each pair of cluster can be seen on Figure~\ref{fig:Mann Whitney significance}. We can indeed observe that
cluster 1 shows to be statistically bigger than all the other clusters in terms of ABSOLUTE purity, except cluster 4.

\section{Materials and Methods}
All of the (Python 3.5) source code used in this study as well as this very document are available at the following web page:
\url{https://github.com/RobinPetit/Breast-Cancer-Purity}. The non-standard libraries used are \texttt{scipy} (1.1.0) and
\texttt{numpy} (1.14.3).

The data used in this study are those provided for the project, comprising 250 samples with both IHC and ABSOLUTE purities and mutations of each gene of Table~\ref{tab:genes}
as well as those required to be downloaded.

\subsection{Significance of Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient}
Significance indices ($p$-values) for Pearson's correlation coefficients are computed by a $t$-score: $t = r_P\sqrt{(N-2)/(1-{r_P}^2)}$ with $r_P$ being Pearson's $r$ and $N$
the sample size since this statistic follows a Student's t with $N-2$ degrees of freedom~\citep{lee1988thirteen} (with bivariate normal distribution assumption which
can be discarded provided the sample size is sufficiently big).

Figure~\ref{fig:r to p} shows the associated $p$-value of every correlation coefficient (in absolute value) as well as significance threshold $p = 0.05$, $p = 0.01$, $p = 0.001$,
and $p = 10^{-8}$ and their associated quantiles. The lower right corner of the figure is a bit messy due to numerical stability issues. Nonetheless, the $p$-values keep
decreasing for higher values of $\abs r$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,trim={0 0 0 1cm},clip]{figs/r_to_p.eps}
\caption{Associated $p$-value for $\abs r$. Dotted red lines represent the significance thresholds and their associated quantiles. Quantiles are displayed in diagonal
on the horizontal axis.\label{fig:r to p}}
\end{figure}

For Figure~\ref{fig:abs vs ihc}, $N=248$ because samples TCGA-C8-A130-01 and TCGA-C8-A133-01 did not have provided IHC purity, so they were removed from the samples
for this correlation analysis. For Table~\ref{tab:correlations}, $N = 250$, i.e. every sample is used to test correlation.

\subsection{Independence tests}
Independence tests between two variables were performed using a $\chi^2$-test. For Figures~\ref{fig:nb mutations vs abs}~and~\ref{fig:nb mutations vs ihc}, the purity is a
continuous variable, therefore it has been discretized into 20 subintervals of equal size in order to make a proper contingency table for the $\chi^2$. Still, this test
doesn't seem appropriate because it is way too sensitive to the discretization of the variable (number of intervals when splitting).

\subsection{NMF Clustering}
The NMF clustering of the samples comes from the one performed by TCGA which was performed on 1093 samples including the 250 samples used in this study. Only the samples
of interest have been kept, the others have been discarded.

The difference of distribution between each pair of clusters has been tested by a two-sided Mann-Whitney $U$ test (Figure~\ref{fig:Mann Whitney significance}) because
the distribution of ABSOLUTE purity per cluster (Figure~\ref{fig:absolute purity distribution per cluster}) is clearly not Gaussian-like, and samples are not numerous enough
for asymptotic results to be of any help. Also, a one-sided Mann-Whitney $U$ test has been performed in order to test the hypothesis that one cluster has higher mean ABSOLUTE
purity than another.

Finally, two more hypotheses have been tested regarding the clustering: each cluster has been tested to show if its ABSOLUTE purity mean is higher than the union of either
all of the other clusters or all the samples; i.e. is cluster $i$'s mean purity higher than mean purity in the whole dataset or higher than mean purity in the whole dataset
except samples of cluster $i$? Again, this has been performed with a one-sided Mann-Whitney $U$ test.

\end{figure*}

\section{Conclusion}
To summarize, it has been found in this project that IHC purity and ABSOLUTE purity slightly correlate but are still very different, meaning that at least one of these is
not a good measure. We followed by assuming that the ABSOLUTE purity was the proper way to measure purity, finding that the $70\%$ purity criterion of TCGA is not well
fulfilled by the provided samples. When looking for genes mutations associated to high ABSOLUTE purity, no convincing result were extracted, but this is probably also
due to the wrong statistical framework applied to it. Also, among the subtypes of cancer that were pre-computed (clusters), two showed statistically significant greater
ABSOLUTE purity than the rest of the samples.
